            flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next

            resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major
            climate on Earth.

            short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American
            breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes
            on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <time datetime="1962"><strong>1962</strong></time> - Visits Delhi

            have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that
            genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand,
            as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently
            dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and
            animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people
            were selecting the best breeds."

            <time datetime="2009"><strong>2009</strong></time> - dies at the age
